# Restart on Death

This is a Geometry Dash mod that reboots your computer whenether you die in the game. It's as bad as it sounds.

Original Idea by GD Colon (I basically just ported it to Geode)

also yeah im not responsible for any data loss

# Installation

Since I don't plan to publish this mod on the index, you need to install it manually. (btw the mod is windows only)

Go to the Releases tab and download the .geode file from the latest release. Since Geode 4, there's a button on the Geode menu on the left that allows you to import a .geode file. Use it to install the mod.
